Epic Generator
==============

Let's make history!

It's a rather complex way of doing things, but this application generates a
world and then proceeds to populate it. This population, a mix of the semi-normal
(humans, elves, and Terran, which I made up) and the demonic (Furies, dragons,
and titans) then weaves a story: waging war, expanding, dying, farming... in
short, this is a civilization sim.
